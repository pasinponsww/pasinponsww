# Hello, Iâ€™m Bex Sawetrattanathumrong  

I am a second-year Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in embedded systems and hardware security. My work focuses on bridging low-level hardware with secure system design, developing firmware, and exploring how physical systems integrate with secure communication and cloud services.  

I have hands-on experience with microcontrollers (ESP32, STM32), FPGAs, and peripheral driver development, as well as practical skills in C/C++, Python, and Verilog. My current projects involve embedded firmware, hardware-level security features, and secure data handling between devices.  

I am eager to continue growing in the areas of embedded system design and hardware security, while collaborating on projects that push technical boundaries and have real-world impact.  

## Technical Skills  
- Programming: C/C++, Python, Verilog  
- Hardware & Tools: ESP32, STM32, FPGAs (Xilinx/Gowin), RFID  
- Areas of Focus: Embedded Systems, Hardware Security, Driver Development
