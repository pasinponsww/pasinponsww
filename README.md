# üëã Hello, I‚Äôm **Bex Sawetrattanathumrong**  

I am a **Computer Engineering student** with a strong focus on **embedded systems** and **hardware security**. My work explores the bridge between **low-level hardware** and **secure system design** ‚Äî developing firmware, creating drivers, and connecting physical systems with secure communication and cloud services.  

I have hands-on experience with **microcontrollers (ESP32, STM32)**, **FPGAs**, and **peripheral driver development**, along with practical programming in **C/C++**, **Python**, and **Verilog**. My projects focus on embedded firmware, hardware-level security, and secure device-to-cloud communication.  

I‚Äôm eager to grow further in **embedded system design** and **hardware security**, collaborating on projects that push technical boundaries and deliver real-world impact.
